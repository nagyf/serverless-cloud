# Welcome to Serverless Cloud

This project is a demo/learning project to advance my knowledge in AWS and architecting.

Serverless cloud is a self-hosted file storage solution, similar to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) and [Owncloud](https://owncloud.com/).

Goals:
- Unlimited file storage
- Infinite scalability
- Secure file storage with multiple users
